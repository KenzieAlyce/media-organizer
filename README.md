# media-organizer

Goals for app
- Keep track of media content
- Document resources of media 
- Help recall past series/media usage 
- Where it was purchased/where it's located
- Social media-bond over media type
People frequently access a variety of media content (books, music, movies, games) from an ever larger variety of sources. It can be difficult to keep track of where you've accessed it, where it's stored, and to always remember what you've seen or purchased. This application would create a simple way for users to keep track of all their media consumption and all the media they own in type and location.

User Story
As a user of various types of media content,
